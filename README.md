"Wireshark ICMP Ping Packet Capturing and Analysis"
# Ping Analysis using Wireshark

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to capture and analyze ICMP packets generated by the `ping` command using Wireshark. It helps to understand the role of ICMP in network diagnostics and how devices communicate to check connectivity.

## Steps Performed  
1. Open Command Prompt (or Terminal) and type:  
   ```bash
   ping www.wikipedia.org
This sends ICMP Echo Request packets to the Wikipedia server.

Simultaneously, start capturing packets using Wireshark on the active network interface.

After capturing sufficient packets, stop the capture in Wireshark.

Use the filter:

icmp


to isolate ICMP packets.

Identify and analyze the Echo Request and Echo Reply packets:

Echo Request: Sent by your machine to check if the target is reachable.

Echo Reply: Response from the target confirming it is reachable.

Optionally, filter by IP address of Wikipediaâ€™s server to narrow down packets:

ip.addr == 103.102.166.224

What I Learned

The ICMP protocol structure and its role in network troubleshooting.

Real-time interaction between devices via Echo Request and Reply packets.

Using Wireshark filters effectively to analyze specific network traffic.
